      "description": "Predominantly grayscale, ranging from very light grey/white backgrounds to dark grey/black panels. A vibrant neon green serves as the primary accent color for highlights, progress indicators, and connecting lines. Pure white is used for text, glows, and reflective elements."

      "font_family_style": "Clean, modern sans-serif, with a slightly geometric feel.",
      "weights_and_sizes": "Varied weights (light, regular, bold) and sizes are used to establish a clear visual hierarchy. Large, bold text is used for primary branding and titles, while smaller, lighter text is used for detailed descriptions, labels, and metadata.",

      "information_panels_arrangement": "Panels are strategically placed around the central subject, often overlapping or connected by thin, glowing lines. They vary in shape (rectangles, trapezoids, irregular polygons with sharp angles) and size, creating a modular, data-rich interface.",
      "hierarchy_principles": "Visual hierarchy is clearly established through the size, contrast, color, and strategic placement of elements. Key information is made prominent through larger text, accent colors, or distinct panel designs.",
      "connecting_elements": "Thin, glowing lines (often neon green or white) are used extensively to visually link related data points, panels, or sections, suggesting data flow, system connections, or interactive pathways."

      "glows_and_reflections": "Extensive use of subtle white or neon green glows around key elements, text, and connecting lines, creating a futuristic and illuminated effect. Reflective surfaces are present on some UI elements, particularly buttons or toggles.",
      "transparency_and_layering": "Semi-transparent or frosted glass-like overlays are used for many panels, allowing background elements to subtly show through and creating a sense of depth and layering.",
      "geometric_overlays": "Sharp-edged geometric shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, polygons) are frequently used as frames, backgrounds, or decorative elements within panels, reinforcing the tech aesthetic.",
      "grid_and_dot_patterns": "Subtle grid lines or dot patterns are incorporated within panels or as background textures to enhance the data-driven, technical feel.",
